# 🛠️ API Automation Roadmap: Rest Assured + Cucumber BDD

This roadmap will guide you through building a robust API test automation framework using **Java**, **Rest Assured**, and **Cucumber BDD**, from foundational knowledge to CI/CD integration and advanced tooling.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundations

**🌟 Goal:** Understand the basics of API testing and Java.

* Learn basic Java (if needed)
* Understand key concepts:

  * What is an API?
  * What is REST (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)?
  * What is API Testing?

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Rest Assured + Cucumber BDD Basics

**🌟 Goal:** Automate simple API tests using BDD.

* Set up a Maven project with required dependencies
* Write basic `GET` and `POST` tests using Rest Assured
* Create your first `.feature` file using Gherkin syntax
* Map feature steps to Java step definitions
* Execute tests via `TestRunner.java`

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Organize & Reuse Code

**🌟 Goal:** Make your test framework maintainable and scalable.

* Create reusable utility methods for:

  * Setting headers
  * Building payloads
  * Parsing JSON responses
* Manage separate environment configurations (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`)
* Use Cucumber hooks:

  * `@Before` – Set up base URI, authentication, etc.
  * `@After` – Logging, cleanup, teardown

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Reporting

**🌟 Goal:** Visualize and share test results effectively.

* Integrate:

  * **Cucumber HTML Reports**
  * **Allure Reports** (recommended)
* Configure Maven plugins for automatic report generation
* Generate reports in CI pipelines

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Tagging & Parallel Execution

**🌟 Goal:** Organize and scale tests efficiently.

* Use Cucumber `@tags` to categorize tests:

  * Example: `@smoke`, `@login`, `@regression`
* Run specific tags via CLI:

  ```bash
  mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@login"
  ```
* Enable parallel execution with `cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin`

---

## ✅ Phase 6: CI/CD Integration

**🌟 Goal:** Automate test execution in CI/CD pipelines.

* Set up a basic CI pipeline using:

  * **GitHub Actions**
  * **Jenkins**
* Install Java and run Maven tests within the pipeline
* Publish HTML/Allure reports as build artifacts

---

## ✅ Phase 7: Advanced Tools (Optional)

**🌟 Goal:** Enhance test coverage and test quality.

* **Data-Driven Testing:**

  * Read test data from JSON, CSV, or Excel
* **API Mocking:**

  * Use **WireMock** to simulate external APIs
* **Security Testing:**

  * Integrate **OWASP ZAP** for security scans
* **Test Management Integration:**

  * Push results to **TestRail**, **Zephyr**, or **Xray** via APIs

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use **Postman** for manual API testing before automation
* Add `log().all()` in Rest Assured for debugging requests/responses
* Keep scenarios **independent** and **stateless**
* Store sample request/response payloads for future reference
* Implement **retry logic** for flaky endpoints
